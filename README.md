# ActivityContext

ActivityContext is a library for tracking logical context of the operations across boundaries.

Scope of activity is created using simple API and flows across Tasks or WCF calls without any additional effort as ambient context.
It's a valuable addition to logging for any N-Tier (distributed) application.

ActivityContext will provide integration with most used .NET logging libraries: **Log4Net** and **NLog**.
